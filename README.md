Message Encryptor in Python 🔐

This is a simple Python-based message encryptor and decryptor that uses key-based substitution encryption.
The program generates a randomized key to encrypt messages and uses the same key to decrypt them back to the original text.

Features

Encrypts any text message using a shuffled character key

Decrypts encrypted messages back to the original form

Uses Python’s string and random modules

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

Why I built this

I built this project while learning Python to understand:

How encryption logic works

Character mapping and indexing

Working with lists, strings, and randomness

This is a learning project and a step toward building more advanced security and AI-related applications.
